# Better-Tree
Efficient tree widget for interactive python applications

Ok, maybe not better. But it works with very large trees (I've tested with 8000 nodes), and there is potential for custom widgets to replace the default button.

Drawbacks:
* The API kinda sucks
* Scrolling with a trackpad sucks
* Scrolling with a mouse feels a little funny but not too bad
* Still no drag-and-drop
